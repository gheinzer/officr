## Goals

My goals are

- to create an easy to use office software
- to create an easy to install office software
- to create an office software, which is used in the browser

Please note that I don't know what things that I want to add to my office software. At the moment, I will use it for school. Because of this, I will firstly include a homework booklet and a mark software. Maybe I will add something like a todo list later on.

## Homework

The homework code is located under `public_html/schoolsoftware/homework`.
